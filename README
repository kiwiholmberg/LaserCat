:::Laserwhaaaat?:::
The goal is to be able to control a laser pointer with a webapp. This could serve as
an advanced cat toy or some kind of targeting system.

There are two parts of the code. Client side which is based on an arduino platform running C code.
Server side which is made with python to serve a web interface to the user.
Between these two parts there is a serial communication thru USB.

:::Requirements::: 
* Computer with Python + pySerial installed. (http://python.org/ and http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/)
* Arduino platform with USB-interface. I use Duemilanove but any Arduino should work. (www.arduino.cc/)
* A HTML5 compliant web browser with web socket support. Latest Google Chrome or Apple Safari.
